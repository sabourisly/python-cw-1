# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8

# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 

# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it

# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it

# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`

# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable


# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
# print("saad")
# print(4 + 4)
# print(10 / 2)
# print(5 * 5)

# length = 85
# width = 50
# area = (length * width)
# print(area)

length_1 = 5
width_1 = 3
area_1 = 15

print(f"if the length of the rectangle is {length_1}, and width is {width_1},then the area is {area_1}")
